## Hi there üçÇ

I'm Pim Snel.

I'm a creative developer, interested in nature, food, and creating and consuming open source software for business and fun.

My job, as a cloud engineer at [TechNative](https://technative.nl) is to maintain, design and build cloud native infrastructure for tech loving customers.

I ‚ù§Ô∏è and truly believe in Open Source. Open source and open idea's make the world a nicer place to live in. Sharing is more fun then to be rich and lonely. 

[My üá≥üá± dutch website](https://pimsnel.nl) has some writings.
